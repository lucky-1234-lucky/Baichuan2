The following SQL command will achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT p.problem_id\nFROM problems p\nJOIN problem_log pl ON p.problem_id = pl.problem_id\nJOIN staff s ON pl.assigned_to_staff_id = s.staff_id OR pl.reported_by_staff_id = s.staff_id\nWHERE s.staff_first_name = 'Rylan' AND s.staff_last_name = 'Homenick'\n  AND p.date_problem_reported > (\n    SELECT MAX(p2.date_problem_reported)\n    FROM problems p2\n    WHERE p2.reported_by_staff_id = pl.reported_by_staff_id\n  );\n```\n\nThis query first joins the `problems` table with itself using the `problem_id` column to find the latest date of reporting for each problem. It then joins the `problem_log` table with the `staff` table to identify the staff who reported or were assigned the problem. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only those problems reported by Rylan Homenick."
